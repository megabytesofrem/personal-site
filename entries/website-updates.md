As you may have noticed, this site has gone through a <u>few</u> redesigns since I originally
published it. This is because the view I had for the website has been continually expanding.
Originally, I wanted a small space on the internet for myself and then I added a small micro-blog aspect to it.

The small blog is generated statically by a Python script in the root of the repository, which parses
entries located in entries and statically outputs HTML. Maybe I'll make a post on it's inner workings one day.
