Today I woke up, checked my YouTube feed and saw a <a href="https://youtu.be/1Se2zTlXDwY">video</a> by the Primeagen that really stood out to me.

We live in an age where we can just prompt a large-language model<sup>1</sup> to "create a webapp to store, for e.g
a list of first and last names" and have the AI model "autocomplete" the whole project. While at first
this may sound appealing: there are a few <b>major</b> downsides.

<ol>
  <li>Privacy - Every query is being stored and can be used for training. This can be a 
       <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-doge-running-highly-sensitive-government-data-through-ai-report-2000560381isaster">disaster</a>
      if the data is sensitive in nature.
  </li>
  <li>Accuracy - AI tends to hallucinate a lot and can be very misleading</li>
  <li>Learning - Overusing AI results in a dependence on the AI and inhibits learning</li>
  <li>Environmental - AI consumes as much power as a small country<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>

Instead of prompting an AI, take time to research the topics yourself. You may learn something new.

We survived 10+ years without AI.
